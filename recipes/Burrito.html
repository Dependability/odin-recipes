        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step one is to heat the sunflower oil up in a large pan. Fry the onions for 5 minutes and then add seasoning such as oregano and garlic, cooking for one to two minutes. Take the beef mince and place into the pan, stirring with the other ingredients until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Stir sugar into the beef mixture, and then pour a little vinegar over it. If you aren’t planning on freezing your burritos, this is when you can add chopped tomatoes to the beef mixture and stir it in.            </li>
            <li>Simmer your beef mix for around 5 minutes, and then add the black beans, continuing to simmer for an additional 20 minutes. During this time, you can add additional spices depending on your preference.</li> 
            <li>Take the tortillas out of their packaging and begin to heat them according to the instructions on their packaging. Once you have heated the tortillas and they are ready to go, begin lining up rice and beef along with each tortilla, making sure to add any toppings you like such as tomatoes, cucumber, or lettuce.</li>
            <li>Fold over the ends of the burrito in order to seal them so that the filling doesn’t fall out. Serve immediately, or leave to cool if you wish to freeze them.</li>
